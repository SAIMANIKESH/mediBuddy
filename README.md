Created the "mediBuddy Assignment" as shown or provided in Figma...
But unable to publish code

my code output -> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Nl-DAqx9UlRfVS5Qf4rL-mPiFz0onkPG/view?usp=sharing
given code in Gigma Output -> https://www.figma.com/proto/e0Q4cOMsJu7g94kwFxNX1T/Designs-for-Dev-Assignments_Jan25?node-id=1-1697&t=flzP7Wy4oLBzZlD8-0&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1
if password requires for Figma then -> "YourHealthBuddy"

Due to less time (2 days) just focused on speed, not perfection! and given my best to get as close as my output to figma output...

Thank you
